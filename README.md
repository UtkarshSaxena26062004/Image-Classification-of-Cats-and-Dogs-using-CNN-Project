# Image-Classification-of-Cats-and-Dogs-using-CNN-Project
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. CNNs are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for analyzing visual data. Using the popular Cats vs. Dogs dataset, the model is trained to identify whether an input image contains a cat or a dog with high accuracy.

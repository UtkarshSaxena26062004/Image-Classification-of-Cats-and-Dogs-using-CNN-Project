<pre> # 🐱🐶 Image-Classification-of-Cats-and-Dogs-using-CNN-Project This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. CNNs are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for analyzing visual data. Using the popular Cats vs. Dogs dataset, the model is trained to identify whether an input image contains a cat or a dog with high accuracy. Also, this project demonstrates how to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify images of cats and dogs using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. --- ## 📁 Dataset - **Source**: [Kaggle - Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data) - Contains thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs. - Images are resized to **256x256** for model input. > ⚠️ **Note:** > To access the dataset, you will need a **Kaggle account** and an **API key**. > Follow the instructions below to set it up. --- ## 🔐 Setting up Kaggle API Key 1. Go to [https://www.kaggle.com/account](https://www.kaggle.com/account) 2. Scroll to **"API" section** → Click on **"Create New API Token"** 3. A file named `kaggle.json` will be downloaded. 4. Place it in your working directory or upload it in Google Colab. 5. Run this code to set it up: ```python !pip install kaggle import os os.environ['KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR'] = '/content' ``` --- ## 🧠 Model Architecture ```python model = Sequential() model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(256, 256, 3))) model.add(BatchNormalization()) model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))) model.add(Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu')) model.add(BatchNormalization()) model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))) model.add(Flatten()) model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) # Binary classification ``` --- ## 🧪 Model Training - **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy - **Optimizer**: Adam - **Epochs**: 10+ - **Validation Split**: 20% --- ## 📊 Results - The model achieves good validation accuracy. - Can successfully classify new images of cats and dogs. --- ## 🚀 How to Run ### 🔗 Run in Google Colab: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/UtkarshSaxena26062004/Image-Classification-of-Cats-and-Dogs-using-CNN-Project/blob/main/My_IBM_AI_Project.ipynb) ### 🖥️ Run Locally: 1. **Clone the repository:** ```bash git clone https://github.com/UtkarshSaxena26062004/Image-Classification-of-Cats-and-Dogs-using-CNN-Project cd Image-Classification-of-Cats-and-Dogs-using-CNN-Project ``` 2. **Install dependencies:** ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt ``` 3. **Download dataset from Kaggle** (needs API key as mentioned above) 4. **Run the notebook**: Open `My_IBM_AI_Project.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Colab --- ## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies - Python - TensorFlow / Keras - NumPy, Pandas - Matplotlib - Google Colab - Kaggle API --- ## 📦 Project Structure ``` 📁 Image-Classification-of-Cats-and-Dogs-using-CNN-Project/ ├── My_IBM_AI_Project.ipynb # Main notebook ├── model_catsvsdogs.h5 # Trained model file ├── Data/ # Dataset directory (not uploaded) └── README.md # This file ``` --- ## ✍️ Author **Utkarsh Saxena** 📍 Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh 🔗 [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/UtkarshSaxena26062004) --- ## 🎓 Training Note This project was created by me during my training on **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** conducted by **IBM**. It was part of a **PBEL (Project Based Experiential Learning)** program focused on hands-on learning through real-world projects. --- ## 🌟 Support If you find this project useful, please ⭐ star the repository and share it! --- Let me know if you also want: - A `requirements.txt` file - Screenshots of predictions - A deployment version using Streamlit or Flask I'm happy to help! </pre>
